<h1><b>Song Recommender using Turicreate</b></h1>
<p>In this project, I have created a Song Recommender System using Turicreate Library and created two models i.e a model that uses <b>popularity</b> of songs to recommend songs and another model that recommends songs based on <b>personalization</b>. Then I have compared the two models to find out which of the 2 models recommends better and found out that the one which is personalized performs better.</p>
